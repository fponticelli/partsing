You can use it to build parsers/decoders from string or really any input values.\nIf you want full control over what to decode your should start from partsing/core/decoder. It provides 3 types parameters\n\nIn for the input. Remember that you will need to decode one portion of your input at the time and your input probably needs to track somehow the current position.\nOut it's the type of the value if successfully decoded.\nErr it's the type of the failure returned when the parser fails.\n\nThe library provides two additional set of utility functions to decode string values (partsing/text) and native JS values (partsing/value).\nDecoder Error\nIf you adopt the generic Decoder directly, you can define the shape of your error. The library provides a DecoderError type that should fit most decoding needs. The type of errors available are defined in partsing/error.\nDecoderError provides a simple method to debug the result of the decoding (toString) but still leaves the flexibility to give granular control on the representation of the error.\nBoth [Text Decoding] and [Value Decoding] use DecodeError.\nText Decoding\nTo be able to keep track of the position of the decoding within a string, Text Decoding uses TextInput to track both the entire text input and the current index.\nThe decodeText function simplifies the inputs and outputs of decoding text. It takes a text decoder (Decoder) and return a function that takes a string input and returns a DecodeResult (where input and error are of type string).\nIf you intend to write your own regular expressions decoder functions, consider using the y (sticky) flag. When used, there is no need to reallocate slices of the input string saving memory and CPU cycles. The sticky flag is not available for all implementations of JS.\nValue Decoding\nTo be able to keep track of the position of the decoding within any value, Value Decoding uses ValueInput to track both the input value and the current position within it using a path. path is an array of either string (object field name) or number (array/tuple index position).\nThe decodeValue function simplifies the inputs and outputs of decoding values. It takes a value decoder (Decoder) and return a function that takes any and returns a DecodeResult (where input is of type any and error is of type string).\nExample\nA simple decoder combinator to parse color values from strings into class instances.\nclass RGB {\n  constructor(readonly rgb: number) {}\n}\n\nclass Grey {\n  constructor(readonly value: number) {}\n}\n\nclass HSL {\n  constructor(readonly hue: number, readonly saturation: number, readonly lightness: number) {}\n}\n\ntype Color = RGB | Grey | HSL\n\nconst ratioDecoder = regexp(/0[.]\\d+/y).map(Number)\nconst rgbDecoder   = regexp(/[#]([0-9a-f]{6})/iy, 1)\n                       .map(v => parseInt(v, 16))\n                       .map(v => new RGB(v))\nconst greyDecoder  = matchInsensitive('grey').or(DecodeError.combine, matchInsensitive('gray'))\n                       .skipNext(optionalWhitespace)\n                       .pickNext(ratioDecoder)\n                       .map(v => new Grey(v))\nconst hslDecoder   = matchInsensitive('hsl(')\n                       .pickNext(\n                         ratioDecoder\n                           .repeatWithSeparator(3, match(','))\n                           .map(v => new HSL(v[0], v[1], v[2]))\n                       )\n                       .skipNext(match(')'))\n\nconst colorTextDecoder = decodeText(\n    oneOf(\n      DecodeError.combine,\n      rgbDecoder,\n      greyDecoder,\n      hslDecoder\n    ).skipNext(eoi) // make sure that there is nothing left to decode\n  )\n\n// all results are wrapped in a DecodeSuccess\n// colorTextDecoder('#003355')          == new RGB(0x003355)\n// colorTextDecoder('gray 0.3')         == new Grey(0.3)\n// colorTextDecoder('gray0.2')          == new Grey(0.2)\n// colorTextDecoder('HSL(0.1,0.2,0.3)') == new HSL(0.1,0.2,0.3)Another scenario where decoding comes in handy is to validate, type and transform payloads from JSON requests. You can decode a value (after being parsed by JSON.parse) into one of the Color types described above.\nA few examples of valid JSON payloads:\n\"#003366\"{ \"grey\": 0.5 }{ \"kind\": \"hsl\", \"h\": 0.2, \"s\": 0.5, \"l\": 0.8 }Here is a colorValueDecoder definition that can deal with those cases:\nconst ratioValue = numberValue.test(v => v >= 0 && v  ({ input, index: 0 }), v => v)\n\n// example: { \"grey\": 0.5 }\nconst greyValue = objectValue(\n    { grey: ratioValue },\n    [] // the empty array means that no fields are optional\n  ).map(v => new Grey(v.grey))\n\n// example: { \"kind\": \"hsl\", \"h\": 0.2, \"s\": 0.5, \"l\": 0.8 }\nconst hslValue = objectValue(\n    {\n      kind: literalValue('hsl'),\n      h: ratioValue,\n      s: ratioValue,\n      l: ratioValue\n    },\n    []\n  ).map(v => new HSL(v.h, v.s, v.l))\n\nconst colorValueDecoder = decodeValue(\n    oneOf(\n      DecodeError.combine,\n      rgbValue,\n      greyValue,\n      hslValue\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\n                             Apache License\n                       Version 2.0, January 2004\n                    http://www.apache.org/licenses/   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nDefinitions.\n\"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\nand distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n\"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\nthe copyright owner that is granting the License.\n\"Legal Entity\" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\nother entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\ncontrol with that entity.
